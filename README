= rails_service_check

When hitting the homepage with pingdom won't do, but you're too lazy to
organise some proper monitoring.

This is just a quick hacky solution to a problem I needed to solve - use
something as dumb as a remote http request verify that the main services
required for my application to function are working. It's a very long way
off being anything near an ideal solution, but it does the job.

== Usage

Create an initializer and add checks by calling RailsServiceCheck.add

    # Add a predefined check (pre-defined checks are classes within the
    # RailsServiceCheck::Checks namespace that have a #run method)
    RailsServiceCheck.add :smtp

    # Add a pre-defined check, but pass some options to the initialize method
    RailsServiceCheck.add :solr_connection, :timeout => 5

    # Add a new check by passing a block
    RailsServiceCheck.add :foo do
      'foo'
    end

Send a http get request to run all checks

    curl -i http://mysite/service_check

== Notes

This is some experimental shit, it'll probably break.

== License

The don't sue me if it breaks license.
